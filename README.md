# imgur

Project that consumes imgur api to show imgur gallery and image details screens.

# Flutter Developer Task

Welcome , this document is intended to be used as a guide to the task provided - it’s important to
note that there is no right or wrong answer here and to take as long as you need. Our intended
effort for this task is no more than half a day.
Using Flutter, please build a small image sharing application. You should use an existing free image
API such as imgur or equivalent.
This exercise tests your ability to use a REST API, json data and UI elements. Feel free to use any
State Management you’re comfortable with such as GetX, BLoC, Provider...

# App Requirements

● Home page showing the most popular images from imgur
● The home page should have a search bar that the user can type into to search for images on imgur
eg yoda
● Search results should be presented in a tiled format
● Tapping an image should navigate to a screen showing a larger view with details about the image (
Optional: add the option to favourite an image)
● You should write your code in a way that it can be tested using unit tests and include unit tests
in your application

# Optional

● The app home should use paging in the API query to retrieve more results as the user scrolls down
the list (“infinite scroll”)
● The app should give quick access to favourite images with an option to remove an image from
favourites
● The app should give quick access to recent searches with an option to clear the search history

# Out of Scope

● Sign up/registration
● Store favourites / recent searches using the API - locally is fine
